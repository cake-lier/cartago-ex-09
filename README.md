# JaCaMo by exercises — Exercise 09 — Java data-binding

In this exercise, you'll need to work with a "Plain Old Java Object" (POJO, for short).
This object is a simple counter that can start counting from zero by default or by another value if given.
It can then be incremented, and it can return its value.
It can also return the name of its class as a static method.
You are asked to instantiate an object from the "Counter"
class representing these objects, both with and without an initial value.
In both cases, you need to call the "increment" method passing the amount by which increment,
and the "getCount" method for getting the actual count value.
In the end, you need to call on the class the method for returning the name of itself.
The CArtAgO library offers you some internal actions to instantiate objects and call class and instance methods.
